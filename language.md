# Fixing language problems

Windows often gets confused that you want to have an English version Windows but still have your local formating and keyboard. So whenever you hit Win-Space by mistake, it changes the keyboard layout to US. We shall fix that!

## Remove 'US' language

1. Launch **Regedit**
2. Go to **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layouts\00000409**
3. Right click the folder called **0000409**
4. Rename it to **0000409-NO**
5. Reboot your PC

## Remove the langauge selector
1. Go to Settings â†’ Time & Language
2. Click **"Typing"**
3. Click **"Advanced keyboard settings"**
4. Uncheck both **"Switching input methods"**

## Remove US keyboard
1. Go to Settings â†’ Time & Language â†’ Language & region
2. Click the **"..."** next to "English (United States)
3. Click **"Add a keyboard"** doesn't matter which keyboard layout
4. Click the **"..."** next to the newly added keyboard and remove it

## Remove magnifier shortcut
It's really annoying when you accidentally hit the shortcut for the magnifier app. And it's a bit more involved removing that feature.

In Windows Terminal, do the following:
```powershell
takeown /f C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe
cacls C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe /G administrators:F
cd "C:\Windows\System32"
ren Magnify.exe Magnify.exe.bak
```

## Check that time is syncing
I have experienced that Windows isn't automatically syncing the time in Windows, so after a while 2FA-codes won't sync correctly.

1. Open Settings â†’ Time & Language â†’ Date & Time
2. Make sure that **"Set time zone automatically"**, **"Set time automatically"** and **"Show time and date in the System tray"** are all on.
3. Click **"Sync now"**
4. **Win+R** and type **Services.msc**
5. Find **"Windows Time"** and check that it's set to **"Automatic"**
