# Welcome to the Reinstall Guide
This guide was made for personal use because I wanted to remember everything I needed to keep safe, and to make the reinstall process easier. Plus, I love making lists and shit like that.

A friend asked me to give him the files, so of course I over did it. The files started as .txt documents, but is now a repo. Why? Eh?

Seeing this from the repo page? [Click here.](https://visnes.github.io/windows-reinstall-guide)

# Things to remember
This is a guide that works for me. It might not work for you. I'm not responsible for you fucking your shit up. Thanks.
