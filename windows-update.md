# Windows Update

> [!TIP] 
> Windows doesn't come optimized and does a lot of weird stuff I don't like. These are some of them.

## Windows Updates drivers
You can update drivers through Windows Update if you want
```
Settings → Windows Update → Advanced Options → Optional Updates
```
## Update other drivers
If you installed the **Intel Driver & Support Assistant**, you can double click the icon in the system tray and check if there is anything you need to install there.

## BIOS update
> ⚠️ **Should I update my BIOS?**  
> If you aren't experiencing any problems, and the update isn't critical, many suggest you should just leave it alone. Updating the BIOS *can* introduce problems if you have none.

Check your motherboard provider and see if there are any BIOS updates. You can also check if there are any new Windows Driver updates that you should be installing. Specifially chipset drivers.
